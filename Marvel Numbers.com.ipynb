Meanwhile, last <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/news/231830830-2018-Preview-July\">July</A> wasn’t as strong on top with just two films topping $200 million, <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Mission-Impossible-Fallout\">Mission: Impossible - Fallout</A> and <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Ant-Man-and-the-Wasp\">Ant-Man and the Wasp</A>, neither of which came close to $300 million. However, last year had a lot better depth and I think that could result in 2019 merely breaking even in the year-over-year competition. \n",

      "It is an absolute nightmare on the home market. There’s no monster hit to talk about, but there are a mountain of new releases that are selling well enough that they could have been featured in the main list and about twice as many that could have been included in the Secondary Blu-ray release. I had to trim some of them to keep the list manageable. Unfortunately, the list of Pick of the Week contenders is rather short with just <I>Megalobox</I>: <A HREF=\"https://www.amazon.com/Megalobox-Season-Limited-BD-Blu-ray/dp/B07QZV3MDL\" target=\"_NewWindow\">Season One</A> and <I>Frankie Drake Mysteries</I>: <A HREF=\"https://www.amazon.com/Frankie-Drake-Mysteries-Season-DVD/dp/B07NRJTV7N\" target=\"_NewWindow\">Season Two</A>, both of which are worth owning.

Its final <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-chart/weekend/2019/04/26\">weekend</A> numbers actually topped the high end expectations, as it opened with $357.12 million. This is almost exactly $100 million more than the previous <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/weekend/any\">record</A>, set this weekend <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-chart/weekend/2018/04/27\">last year</A> by <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Avengers-Infinity-War\">Avengers: Infinity War</A>.

More importantly, this was 29% more than the same weekend <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-chart/weekend/2018/04/27\">last year</A> and this one weekend put a serious dent in 2019’s deficit in the year-over-year comparisons. Granted, 2019 is still behind 2018’s pace by more than 11% or $420 million at $3.28 billion to $3.70 billion. I suspect May will also be a very good month in the year-over-year comparison so hopefully that gap will be more reasonable in a month’s time. I don’t think 2019 will catch up to 2018 any time soon, but if it can cut the deficit in raw dollars in half by the end of May, then I will be happy. \n",

Unsurprisingly, the film’s biggest market is China at $330.5 million. Meanwhile, it is having stunning openings in the U.K. ($53.8 million) and South Korea ($47.4 million). The film will crack $30 million in both Mexico ($33.1 million) and Australia ($30.8 million), and $20 million in Germany ($26.9 million), India ($26.7 million), Brazil ($26.0 million), and France ($24.2 million).  In comparison to other <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Marvel-Cinematic-Universe\">M.C.U.</A> hits, the film will take just five days to top what <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Captain-Marvel-(2019)\">Captain Marvel</A> earned in eight weeks.

In the meantime, we’ve hopefully sunk to the low point in the year-over-year comparison, as 2019 is now behind 2018 by a $570 million or 17% margin at $2.84 billion to $3.41 billion. \n",

This is a great start, especially for a film that “only” cost $85 million to make. However, there’s some bad news here.

Both <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Night-School-(2018)\">Night School</A> and <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Smallfoot\">Smallfoot</A> will earn more than $10 million over the weekend, which will help the overall box office performance.

Even on the low end, <I>Venom</I> will earn more than those two films combined. On the high end, it could match last year’s top five by itself. \n",

The box office needed to break even during the film’s initial push into the home market rose from about $500 million to $650 million. And with an initial international debut of $65.0 million in 54 markets, this film is just not going to get there.

The <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Marvel-Cinematic-Universe\">MCU</A> now has six of the top ten openings of all-time.

The overall box office rose 150% from <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-chart/weekend/2018/04/20\">last weekend</A> to $312 million. This is within a rounding error of the <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/weekend/biggest-overall\">record</A> and we might get there as smaller studios report their numbers later in the week. This is 212% higher than the same weekend <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-chart/weekend/2017/04/28\">last year</A>; granted, this is because summer started a week early this year. Year-to-date, 2018 has retaken the lead by $140 million or 4.0% at $3.78 billion to $3.64 billion. However, and this is important, this is a misleading number, because summer started a week early this year. I would wait till <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Deadpool-2\">Deadpool 2</A> comes out to judge the year-to-date numbers. It will take that long for <I>Infinity War</I> coming out a week early to fully balance out. You will probably make solid judgments before then, but I think it is wise to be a little cautious. \n",

The only potential big hit that didn’t miss expectations was <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Ready-Player-One\">Ready Player One</A>. Because of this, 2018 lost its lead over 2017 and is now over $100 million behind last year’s pace. April is usually a terrible month, because it is a dumping ground, especially late in the month. No studio wants to compete with the first monster hit of the Summer. This year, the first monster hit of the summer, <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Avengers-Infinity-War\">Avengers: Infinity War</A>, opens in April. It will make more during its opening weekend than any other April release will make in total. It might make more opening day than any other April release will make in total. The only film that has a real chance to earn more than $100 million is <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Rampage-(2018)\">Rampage</A>, a video game adaptation. Last <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/news/220920830-2017-Preview-April\">April</A>, <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Fate-of-the-Furious-The\">The Fate of the Furious</A> earned more than $1.2 billion worldwide, but “only” earned $225.76 million of that domestically. <I>Infinity War</I> should earn more than that opening weekend.

Meanwhile, ticket prices rose 4% to $8.97. This means total attendance was 1.236 billion, the lowest since 1995. That is troubling, but not as apocalyptic as some have made it out to be, as it is only 2.7% lower than 2014’s attendance figure. Obviously, we would like to see increases in this figure every year, but we shouldn’t panic just yet. If 2018 bounces back, then we can still say the overall box office is healthy.

This week we will tackle first run releases, and normally franchise box sets as well, but this year none jump out as essential additions to the Holiday Gift guide.

Additionally, some of the <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Beauty-and-the-Beast-(2017)\">biggest</A> and <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Logan-(2017)\">some</A> of the <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Get-Out-(2017)\">best</A> have been on the home market for nearly half a year, meaning nearly everyone  who would want them, already own them. That doesn’t mean there are no films worth adding to this list, but the list is a little shorter than usual. On a side note, two of the films on this year’s list are from the <A HREF=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Marvel-Cinematic-Universe>MCU</A> and it would have been three, but <A HREF=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Thor-Ragnarok>Thor: Ragnarok</A> is still in theaters.

I would love to say November will turn things around, but, while it should be better, in this case “better” is a relative term. There are two films on this list with a chance at $300 million, <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Thor-Ragnarok\">Thor: Ragnarok</A> and <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Justice-League-(2017)\">Justice League</A>, while <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Coco-(2017)\">Coco</A> is nearly a guarantee for $200 million. By comparison, last <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/news/216970830-2016-Preview-November\">November</A> had a similar result with three films earning between $200 million and $300 million, but none topping that figure. This means, if <I>Thor: Ragnarok</I> and <I>Justice League</I> both get to that milestone, then 2017 could cut into 2016’s lead during the month. It will still take a minor miracle for 2017 to catch up in the end, but just cutting the lead in half by the end of December would be a reason to celebrate at this point.  \n",

The film opened in second place in Japan, where it pulled in $3.0 million, which is 15% better than the original <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy\">Guardians of the Galaxy</A> did. On the downside, this is the film’s last market to open in, so it will be coasting on holdovers from now on. Speaking of holdovers, the film’s biggest market is China, where it added $15.16 million over the weekend for a total of $80.56 million. This is the film’s biggest single market and it could hit $100 million there shortly. \n",

Firstly, the <A REL=\"nofollow\" HREF=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beauty_and_the_beast_2017\" target=\"_NewWindow\">reviews</A> improved to 71% positive, which is still lower than anticipated, but good enough to not hurt the film’s legs. Additionally, it earned a solid A from CinemaScore. Strangely, the demographics changed, with women representing 72% of Friday’s audiences. That’s up from just under 60% during Thursday’s previews and a lot of times it goes in the other direction. So what does this mean for the future? The film just needs an internal multiplier above 2.6 to become the biggest <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/biggest-weekend-by-month/march\">March</A> opening of all time. That seems very likely at this point. In fact, anything less than $175 million will be seen as a little disappointing. \n",

However, it was also a more steady month than last October and the last two weeks really helped 2016 in the year-over-year comparisons.  In November, we have five films with at least a shot at $100 million, three of which should have no trouble getting to at least $200 million. A little while ago, I thought <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Fantastic-Beasts-and-Where-to-Find-Them\">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</A> would be the biggest hit of the month, but the buzz took a hit recently.

Last <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/news/209140830-2015-Preview-November\">November</A> was similar in strength, with five films that earned more than $100 million and two films that earned more than $200 million. None earned more than $300 million, so that’s the goal for this November. If we can get one $300 million and / or three $200 million movies over the month, then it will be seen as a victory. \n",

Our model projects that it will fall just short of $180 million, but either way it will set easily a new <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/market/2016/summary\">best weekend in 2016</a>, beating the $166 million debut of <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Batman-v-Superman-Dawn-of-Justice#tab=summary\">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a>, and record the <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/records/Biggest-Domestic-Weekends\">fifth-best weekend of all time</a>, landing in between <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Avengers-Age-of-Ultron-The#tab=summary\">The Avengers: Age of Ultron</a> and <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Iron-Man-3#tab=summary\">Iron Man 3</a>.

That's what happens when you get a surprise $300 million hit. This bodes well for May, which is both a slow month and a fantastic month. There are only four weekends and only eight movies coming out, but of those eight films, five have a shot at $100 million. The potential blockbusters are led by <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Captain-America-Civil-War\">Captain America: Civil War</A>, which is not only going to be the biggest hit of the month, but according to a Fandango survey, it is the most anticipated film of the summer. (On a side note, <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Finding-Dory\">Finding Dory</A> is the most anticipated family film of the summer and <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Ghostbusters-(Remake)\">Ghostbusters</A> is the most anticipated comedy of the summer.

Both <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass\">Alice Through the Looking Glass</A> and <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/X-Men-Apocalypse\">X-Men: Apocalypse</A> have real shots at $200 million.

It will be too late to stop him. If he gets less than 40%, then it becomes a real race again. If the polling is correct, then he will get closer to 50% than 40%. On the Democratic side, Sanders needs at least 45% of the delegates, or it is over for him. Anything less than that and Hillary Clinton will have too big a lead to overcome.

Of the five $1 billion movies, this one is arguably the one that had the most disappointing run at the box office.

This is mostly because its predecessor, <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Avengers-The-(2011)\">The Avengers</A>, broke box office records.

Secondly, it is the last week before the fall season begins in earnest, so it is the last week for a lot of shows to come out on DVD before they are running into competition from the new season. It should come as no surprise that the best releases on this week's list are in the TV on DVD categories, including <I>Marvel's Agent Carter</I>: <A REL=\"nofollow\" HREF=\"https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Agent-Carter-Exclusive-Blu-ray/dp/B0117ULG36?tag=thenumbers\" target=\"_NewWindow\">Season 1</A> and <I>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</I>: <A REL=\"nofollow\" HREF=\"https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Agents-S-H-I-E-L-D-Exclusive-Blu-ray/dp/B0117UHFU4?tag=thenumbers\" target=\"_NewWindow\">Season 2</A>.

The bottom line, though, looks as though the film is headed into the weekend a little ahead of expectations.\n",

      "There could be an interesting race on top of the box office charts this weekend, as <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Ant-Man\">Ant-Man</A> will be looking to unseat <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Minions\">Minions</A>. However, while I think <I>Ant-Man</I> will come out on top on Friday, I think <I>Minions</I> will repeat over the weekend. The other new release of the week is <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Trainwreck\">Trainwreck</A>, which has seen its reviews fall from 100% positive to a mere <A REL=\"nofollow\" HREF=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trainwreck/\" target=\"_NewWindow\">90% positive</A>. The amazing reviews and the success of R-rated female-centric films lately suggests it has the potential to reach $100 million. <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Inside-Out-(2015)\">Inside Out</A> and <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Jurassic-World\">Jurassic World</A> will also both hit milestones, so it should be an exciting weekend. This weekend <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-chart/weekend/2014/07/18\">last year</A>, none of the three wide releases were particularly strong, which left <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Dawn-of-the-Planet-of-the-Apes\">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</A> in first place for the second weekend in a row with $36.25 million. Both <I>Minions</I> and <I>Ant-Man</I> will top that. <I>Trainwreck</I> might top that as well. It should be a good weekend for 2015 in the year-over-year comparison.\n",

Its biggest new market was Russia, where it dominated with $11.17 million on 2,192 screens over the weekend. South Korea was close behind with $9.24 million on 1,113 screens for a total opening of $11.06 million. The film earned first place in Mexico with $4.73 million on 1,307 for a total opening of $6.18 million. It only managed second place in Brazil with $3.9 million on 1,012. In all four markets, the film set records for the <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Terminator\">franchise</A>. It wasn't as lucky in the U.K., where it opened in second place with $5.83 million in 536 theaters. That's about on par with its opening here in the US. The goal for the film is to earn over $200 million internationally and $300 million worldwide. If it can get there, then the film will likely break even, eventually. On the other hand, \"breaking even\" isn't enough to justify continuing the reboot trilogy. \n",

      "<A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/news/205310830-2015-Preview-June\">June</A> was a much better month than expected due to two films, <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Jurassic-World\">Jurassic World</A> and <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Inside-Out-(2015)\">Inside Out</A>. Had those two films merely matched expectations, then 2015 would have likely fallen behind 2014. As for this coming month, there are five weekends in July and each week there is at least one film with the potential to reach $100 million. Most weeks there are two films that at least have a shot at getting to the century mark. The biggest hit of the month will likely be <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Minions\">Minions</A>, which has already opened in several international markets and it's ahead of <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Despicable-Me-2\">Despicable Me 2</A> at the same point. That film made more than $300 million and nearly $1 billion worldwide, so any growth would be fantastic. There are also a number of potential $200 million films, led by <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Ant-Man\">Ant-man</A>. <I>Ant-man</I> is the latest release in the <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Marvel-Cinematic-Universe\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</A>, a franchise that has averaged $300 million domestically over eleven films and all of the past six films have reached at least $200 million. I'm not saying this one is guaranteed to do the same, but you can't dismiss that possibility. <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Mission-Impossible-Rogue-Nation\">Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation</A> and <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Pixels\">Pixels</A> have smaller chances to get to $200 million, but you have to at least entertain the possibility. Additionally, last <A HREF=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/news/111590830-2014-Preview-July\">July</A> was a lot weaker than this July looks to be, so 2015 should win in the year-over-year comparison most weeks. Or I might have let the box office success of June cloud my judgment. We will soon find out. \n",
